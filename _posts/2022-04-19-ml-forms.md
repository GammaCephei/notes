# Forms

Here are a few ways commonly used to classify ML systems:

- supervision based
- incremental learning based
- model based

## Supervision

In this classification, there are four main classes based on the amount or type of supervision:

### Supervised

- Data
  - Labelled examples $\large{({\bold x_i},y_i)_{i=1}^N}$
  - $\large x_i$ is a _feature vector_($\large n$-dimensional vector of numerical features $\large x^d$)
    - represent objects numerically e.g. for an image, $\large x^{(1)}$ could be the hue, and $\large x^{(2)}$ could be the intensity
    - useful for comparing objects e.g. euclidean distance
    - granularity depends on the purpose
  - $\large y_i$ can take the form of a member of a set, real number, matrix, vector etc.
- Tasks
  - Classification e.g. spam filter
  - Predict numeric values based on predictors (features) e.g. house price given room numbers and areas
- Goal
  - Train a model on a dataset to predict labels based on input feature vectors
- Methods
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - kNN
  - SVM
  - DT (& random forrests)
  - Neural networks

### Unsupervised

- Data
  - Unlabelled examples $\large{({\bold x_i})_{i=1}^N}$
  - $\large x_i$ is a _feature vector_
- Tasks
  - Clustering - group data points with shared attributes to extrapolate a relationship e.g. molecular structure similarity
  - Anomaly/Outlier detection - find outliers e.g. fraud-detection
- Goal
  - Clustering - transform feature vector $\large \bold x$ into a useful value e.g. an id
  - Dimensionality reduction - output feature vector should have fewer features than $\large \bold x$
  - Anomaly/Outlier detection - output value quantifies the difference of $\large \bold x$ from the data
- Methods
  - Clustering
    - Exclusive
      - K-means
      - Hierarchical
    - Soft
      - Probabilistic e.g. GMM
  - Association
    - Apriori e.g. prior based recommendations
  - Dimensionality reduction
    - PCA
    - SVD
    - Autoencoders
- Challenges
  - Computation and time complexity of training
  - Can be unclear as to basis for clustering
  - Accuracy

### Semi-Supervised

### Reinforcement
